# 🎯 Cursor Rules
This repository contains my personal set of cursor rules, configurations, and utilities. These rules are intended to improve the consistency, accessibility, and user experience of custom web applications by managing cursor behavior and interaction feedback.

## 📁 Structure
- typescript/: A set of rules of typescript.

## 🚀 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to centralize and maintain reusable cursor-related logic, including:

- Custom cursor styles for various UI states (e.g. hover, click, drag).
- Accessibility and UX considerations for interactive elements.
- Potential integrations with CSS-in-JS, React or other frameworks.
